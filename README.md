# Rental
My final year project.

Rental is a web application, where people, who have shifted to new location, can get their dream house to live on rent in cheap and easy way. 

Another aspect of the application is that it also provide people a platform to put the advertisement of their houses and rooms.

It work as a mediator between costumer and the owner. 

It also provide you a range of houses based on your preference as cost, location, features etc.

It is made using django framework of python.
